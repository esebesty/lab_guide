# Code of Conduct

All members of the group, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this
code of conduct. We will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all
members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.  The lab is dedicated
to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate
harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
generally not appropriate for any group venue, including group meetings,
presentations, or discussions. However, do note that we work on biological
matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. We expect members to follow these guidelines at any group-related
event.
