# Getting started with bioinformatics

These are the very first steps you need to do. Here we are focusing on practical
issues, like setting up accounts, making Linux work on your machine, etc, not
papers and research topics.

## GitHub and BitBucket registration

## Version control as a lab notebook

## Code formatting guidelines

## Linux install and the command line

## Installing and compiling tools

## RStudio and R

## CRAN and Bioconductor

## python and conda

## brew

## Automatic login here and there

It can be a pain in the ass to type passwords all the time when you are using
`ssh`. Additionally, `rsync` might be used through `ssh`, where you also need to
type a password.

- [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html). However,
  do consider setting a password for the private key.
- [Passwordless SSH using public-private key
  pairs](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/passwordless-ssh). Discussing some
  aspects of the above password setting problem.

When cloning, pushing, pulling, etc from GitHub or Bitbucket, you can also make
things automatic.
