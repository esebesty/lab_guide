# Student's Scientific Association

As a TDK student you can get useful practical experience in research, get actual
credits based on performance, and participate in the annual scientific
conference of Semmelweis University or your host university. The best
participants usually get some prize money, and can attend the National
Scientific Student's Associations Conference. These events are also useful for
networking, practicing your presentation skills or getting familiar with the
latest research topics and results in various fields. You can even turn your TDK
work into a thesis if it is of sufficient quality.

You need at least 6 months of work to get a certificate of your TDK work that
you can use when applying for scholarships, etc. You need to fill a form,
