# How to survive in the lab
This repository was inspired by the [Greene Lab Onboarding
Repository](https://github.com/greenelab/onboarding) and [Mariam
Aly](https://twitter.com/mariam_s_aly)'s Nature Comment piece, [The key to a
happy lab life is in the manual](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06167-w).

Right now it only contains a Code of Conduct, but hopefully it will evolve.
